# Cellex

A monodimensional cellular automaton explorer. Unlike CellexP, it supports
**arbitrary rules**, not just the elementary cellular automata.

To be more specific, Cellex supports up to 16 states and a transition function of size 4096 at most. Thus, neighborhood size can go up to 11 when the number of state is 2.

## Features

Cellex supports panning, moving around with the keyboard as well as autoscroll down and varying the autoscroll speed.

Zoom is on the way.
