/**
 *
 * @param schedulingFunction A function such as 'requestAnimationFrame', which
 * will run its callback after a time. It could also be for instance:
 * `(f) => setTimeout(f, 99)`. The point is that `schedulingFunction` must take
 * a function as parameter, and must run it after a time.
 *
 * emitterLoop will make transform that scheduling Function into an EventEmitter
 * by making it schedule its next run each time.
 *
 * an emitterLoop can only be subsribed once, using `.link()`, and it can then
 * be discarded using `.discard()` on the object returned by `.link()`. The
 * `discard` method is also available on the emitterLoop object, for situations
 * where you want to start a loop, but later decide not to subscribe anything to
 * it.
 *
 * trying to use `.link()` on an emitterLoop which has already been subsribed
 * to, or which has already been discarded will result in an error being throw
